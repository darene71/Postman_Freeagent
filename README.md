# Postman Collection for the FreeAgent API

Please refer to the official FreeAgent API docs:
https://dev.freeagent.com/docs

### Get Started - [ðŸ“º Video Guide](https://youtu.be/2M182E9Jtmo)

Import the FreeAgent collection, then import the environments.

Fill in the environment variables for `client_id` and `client_secret` from your app, which you can create via our Developer Dashboard:


- Developer Dashboard for Production & Sandbox: 
  - Make sure to set the OAuth Redirect URI to: `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback` when creating your app on Dev Dashboard.
  - https://dev.freeagent.com


Then authorise by
- going to a request, for example `Company Details`
- clicking the `Auth` tab, the link to the authorization helper `FreeAgent`
- Ensure `OAuth 2.0` is selected as the type
- then `Get New Access Token`, and fill in this information:
```
Token Name: Your Token Name
Grant Type: Authorization Code
Callback URL: https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
Auth URL: {{url}}/v2/approve_app
Access Token URL: {{url}}/v2/token_endpoint
Client ID: {{client_id}}
Client Secret: {{client_secret}}
Scope: -
State: -
Client Authentication: Send as Basic Auth Header
```

- and finally `Request Token`, signing in with an account for the appropriate environment.

### Common Gotchas
If your attempt to obtain an access token fails with the `"HTTP Basic: Access denied."` error, check your environment file and ensure the `client_id` and `client_secret` are entered correctly and don't contain any trailing whitespace/newline characters.

### Refreshing the Access Token Automatically

You can set up a [pre-request script](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/scripts/pre-request-scripts/) if you'd like to automate the process of refreshing your access token once it expires. To do this:

- In Postman's left-hand panel, under **Collections**, click on the icon with three dots next to the name of the imported FreeAgent collection
- Select **Edit**
- Open the **Pre-request Scripts** tab and paste in the contents of [auto_refresh_script.js](./auto_refresh_script.js)
- Click **Update** to save
- You'll now have to set up a few environment variables, which you can do by clicking on the eye symbol next to the
environment dropdown in the top-left corner of the Postman app. For each FreeAgent environment you have set up, ensure you have the following variables:

  - `client_id` - your app's OAuth identifier from your Developer Dashboard account
  - `client_secret` - your app's OAuth secret from your Developer Dashboard account
  - `token_url` - token endpoint for the right environment, e.g. `https://api.sandbox.freeagent.com/v2/token_endpoint`
  - `refresh_token` - a valid refresh token for that environment

- Navigate back on the FreeAgent collection **Edit** screen, go to the **Authorization** tab and enter the `{{access_token}}` variable into the **Access Token** field. Click **Update**.

From now on your access token will be refreshed automatically! ðŸŽ‰

# Postman Collection for the FreeAgent API

Please refer to the official FreeAgent API docs:
https://dev.freeagent.com/docs

### Get Started

1. Import the FreeAgent collection

2. Import the environment file(s) for sandbox and/or production. Fill in the environment variables for `client_id`
and `client_secret` from your app, which you can create via our [Developer Dashboard](https://dev.freeagent.com).

  - Make sure to set the OAuth Redirect URI to: `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback` when creating your app
   on Dev Dashboard.

3. Then generate an access and refresh tokens by:
- right-clicking on the collection > Edit > `Authorization`
- click `Get New Access Token`, signing in with an account for the appropriate environment, then click `Proceed`
- and finally `Use Token`.

#### Common Gotchas
If your attempt to obtain an access token fails with the `"HTTP Basic: Access denied."` error, check your environment file and ensure the `client_id` and `client_secret` are entered correctly and don't contain any trailing whitespace/newline characters.

### Refreshing the Access Token Automatically

You can set up a [pre-request script](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/scripts/pre-request-scripts/) if you'd like to automate the process of refreshing your access token once it expires. To do this:

- In Postman's left-hand panel, under **Collections**, click on the icon with three dots next to the name of the imported FreeAgent collection
- Select **Edit**
- Open the **Pre-request Scripts** tab and paste in the contents of [auto_refresh_script.js](./auto_refresh_script.js)
- Click **Update** to save
- You'll now have to set up a few environment variables, which you can do by clicking on the eye symbol next to the
environment dropdown in the top-left corner of the Postman app. For each FreeAgent environment you have set up, ensure you have the following variables:

  - `client_id` - your app's OAuth identifier from your Developer Dashboard account
  - `client_secret` - your app's OAuth secret from your Developer Dashboard account
  - `token_url` - token endpoint for the right environment, e.g. `https://api.sandbox.freeagent.com/v2/token_endpoint`
  - `refresh_token` - a valid refresh token for that environment

- Navigate back on the FreeAgent collection **Edit** screen, go to the **Authorization** tab and enter the `{{access_token}}` variable into the **Access Token** field. Click **Update**.

From now on your access token will be refreshed automatically! ðŸŽ‰
